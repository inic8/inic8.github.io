I am Shashank Pathak. I was born in India in a place named [Allahabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allahabad). I studied in various different places in India, of which the most formative years have been in a small town of Basti, in a terai region i.e., close to the lowest foothills of Himalayas. I still consider the St. Basil's School in Basti to be as monumental in my life as is the contribution of my parents and brothers.
